                    <h3>About Me!</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Howdy! I'm Matson (he/him) and I love exoplanets. It's truly amazing <br>
                        to think that every star in the night likely has worlds of its own. I'm <br>
                        currently a senior at MIT majoring in Physics (Course 8) and minoring <br>
                        in Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS/Course 12). I <br>
                        ultimately seek to understand our place in the Universe through a <br>
                        variety of perspectives, from broad demographics to individual system <br>
                        characterization. To accomplish this and pass on our knowledge to the <br>
                        next generation, my long-term goal is to become a professor. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My past research has focused on the atmospheric modeling of lava <br>
                        worlds and the direct resolution of binary planets/exomoons below the <br>
                        diffraction limit—see below for more information! You can also take <br>
                        a look at my CV <a href="CV.pdf">here</a>. I look forward to expanding my skillset to <br>
                        address the many outstanding questions in exoplanetology and to <br>
                        prepare for future projects like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. <br>
                        In my spare time, I enjoy reading, stargazing, biking, playing <br>
                        <em>Minecraft</em>, and most recently weaving!

                    <h3>Research Project: Lava Worlds</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I began this project in 2024 with MIT Prof. Wanying Kang. <br>
                        Lava worlds are tidally-locked planets so close to their stars that dayside <br>
                        temperatures are high enough to melt rock! It's believed that there are <br>
                        likely two broad atmosphere classes: rock-vapor (thin; poor heat transport) <br>
                        and volatile-rich (thick; efficient heat transport). My research focused <br>
                        on the following question regarding SiO rock-vapor atmospheres: what spectral <br>
                        features might we expect to be observable with current technology and what <br>
                        can they tell us about atmospheric structure? <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the left, you can see the observed spectral emission flux (at 8 microns) with <br>
                        and without absorption by the Δv=1 SiO rovibrational band (assuming an adiabatic <br>
                        atmosphere structure). Simulating the atmosphere ends up being tricky due to the <br>
                        presence of supersonic flows and strong radiative heating effects due to the <br>
                        absorption of infrared starlight; as a result, I developed a custom radiative- <br>
                        transfer and 1D horizontal transport model. Preliminary results suggest that <br>
                        vertical atmospheric structure plays a dominant role in determining the observed <br>
                        emission spectra. I am working on finishing this project and writing up my <br>
                        findings in a first-author paper.

                    <h3>Research Project: Direct Detection of Exomoons</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I began this project in 2025, working closely with Drs. Mary Anne Limbach <br>
                        and Rachel Bowens-Rubin of the University of Michigan. <br>
                        To date, there have been no confirmed detections of exomoons. Numerous <br>
                        methods have been proposed to solve this. We were inspired by the efforts <br>
                        of Lazzoni et al. (2020) to directly detect giant exomoons through <br>
                        VLT/SPHERE direct imaging data. Our central questions were as follows: <br>
                        using JWST/MIRI direct imaging data of the super-Jupiter Epsilon Indi A b, <br>
                        can we detect an exomoon/binary planet in this regime? If not, what <br>
                        constraints can we put on the presence of such companions? 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        We ultimately settled on using the proven technique of double-PSF fitting. <br>
                        This was necessary because our data were taken at long wavelengths, <br>
                        meaning most companions would lie within the diffraction limit. On the left, I <br>
                        have injected a fake companion at a contrast of 0.2 relative to the real <br>
                        planet. The fitted location of the planet and companion are shown with a <br>
                        black X and brown circle, respectively. In this case, we can clearly see <br>
                        the superiority of a double-PSF fit in the residual column. Although no <br>
                        strong exomoon candidates were found, we were able to recover Jupiter-mass <br>
                        companions at wide separations and larger companions down to ~0.52 AU. I've <br>
                        submitted my findings in a first-author paper to The Astronomical Journal!
